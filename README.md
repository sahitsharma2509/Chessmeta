# Chessmeta
Finding the meta in chess from (100,000) games extracted from elite-lichess database link: https://database.nikonoel.fr/ ( 2200+ vs 2400+)

General Info

This is a set of just over 100,000 games collected from https://database.nikonoel.fr/ (Lichess.org), It was available in pgn format and I have taken time to make a collection of 100,000 games and turn it into a .csv format. The dataset contains:

Event;
Round;
White (User);
Black (User);
Result;
BlackElo;
ECO (Standardised Code for any given opening, list here);
Opening (name);
Termination (type);
TimeControl;
WhiteElo;
WhiteRatingDiff;


I haven't included the moves of the games because my intention was to understand the Chess meta i.e which are the popular openings in a given month. This Dataset has 100,000 games played in the month of September 2020.
